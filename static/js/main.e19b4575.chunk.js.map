Their representatives wanted to expand our audience on mobile applications.\n\nThe task was to create a website on which the user can quickly begin to solve his main problem - watching a football match.\n\nAfter receiving all the requirements, several concepts were suggested, from which the customer chose the most suitable option. Further, based on the selected concepts, in the process of developing the main screens.\n<img src=\"./images/nf_02.png\" />\nAlso, the area of my responsibility included the development of application design for the iOS client. After a successful presentation of the design of the application to the customer, it was decided to begin design development for the iPad.\n<img src=\"./images/nf_03.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/nf_04.png\"/>\nAfter that, my task was to finalize the design for the website and create design for the smart TV.\n<img src=\"./images/nf_05.png\"/>\nThis was my first big project, in which I take part as a UX/UI designer. Although much was not clear to me along the way - thanks to the excellent team that supported and trained along the way, I managed to meet the deadlines and make a successful product.\n</p>\n        <div id=\"down_margin\"></div>\n        </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default nf;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n \nclass spbtv extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div id=\"up_margin\"></div>\n        <center><h1>SPB TV Russia</h1></center>\n        <p>\n        To improve the quality and more efficient development of the head platform, the company decided to create its own product. Together with the team, I was able to participate in its creation. Since time allowed - I proposed to approach the design process comprehensively and do research.\n\n        <img src=\"./images/spbtv_01.png\"/>\n\nFirst of all we decided to determine business and user goals for the project. Next, we identified our target audience (TA). It was important for us to collect the maximum amount of information, such as:<br/><br/>\n\n1. age<br/>\n2. gender<br/>\n3. education<br/>\n4. income level<br/>\n5. occupation<br/>\n6. how do these people spend their free time<br/>\n7. What communication channel do they use to receive information more often?<br/>\n8. What platform do they use more often?<br/>\n9. What time do they use our services more often?<br/>\n10. what is the lifestyle of our users<br/>\n\n<img src=\"./images/spbtv_02.png\"/>\nBased on the obtained data, we determined what qualities of our TA will be close - we've created personas. We used the personas further in our joyrney  map. At this stage, we tried to identify errors in the logic, prioritize and improve our solutions.\n<img src=\"./images/spbtv_03.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/spbtv_04.png\"/>\n\n\nAfter that, we gathered as a team and based on all of the above, started brainstorm. As a result, we have created a mind map.  After that, we put together a project scheme with the main pages and started creating visual concepts.\n\n<img src=\"./images/spbtv_05.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/spbtv_06.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/spbtv_07.png\"/>\n\nThis is the first time we have taken such an integrated approach to a project. This was unusual and at some points was not entirely clear. But in general, the impression remained positive and it was an important experience, which I will use in future works.\n</p>\n        <div id=\"down_margin\"></div>\n        </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default spbtv;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n \nclass amediateka extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div id=\"up_margin\"></div>\n        <center><h1>Amediateka</h1></center>\n        <p>\n        One of the clients of SPB TV was Amedia - the Amediateka project. My task was to develop a design for the application for Windows Phone and Windows Tablet.\n        <img src=\"./images/amediateka_01.png\"/>\nSince at the time of work Amediateka had his own corporate identity - this slightly eased my task. I concentrated on creating a native UX for users.\n\nI spent some time exploring the principles, guidelines, and best practices for the Windows mobile platform. After that, together with the project manager, we collected all the functional requirements that should have been in the mobile application.\n\nInitially we decided to use the native elements of the platform (metro style, fonts, errors, icon style). Meanwhile, I really wanted to leave the Amediateka style - I planned to take it from the web (colors, composition, company elements) so that users who are using the service on the web do not have a dissonance when switching to the application.\n    <img src=\"./images/amediateka_02.png\"/>\nAfter defining the concept and general direction, sketches and low fidelity mockups were designed. When they were approved by the team and the customer, I began to work on the details and states screens. For better understanding of big picture I've also created scheme with user flow. This allowed team to see some issues and mistake in logic.\n<img src=\"./images/amediateka_03.png\"/>\n\nIn some cases, for a better understanding of how a particular state or functionality works - I had to make functional presentations. For this, I used After Effects. It was something new in the company, so it took some time for me to work on it. But It was totally worth it - me and managers could decide and play around with this and that to take a decision. It saved development time alot.\n<img src=\"./images/amediateka_04.png\"/>\nAfter the design for Windows Phone was presented and approved, I started working on Windows Tablet.\n<img src=\"./images/amediateka_05.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/amediateka_06.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/amediateka_07.png\"/>\nOf course, working as a team with managers and developers gave me great experience in understanding the processes of developing a mobile application. However, I was very interested to understand the concept of Metro adopted in Windows Phone.\n\n        </p>\n        <div id=\"down_margin\"></div>\n        </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default amediateka;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n \nclass skemio extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div id=\"up_margin\"></div>\n        <center><h1>Skem.io</h1></center>\n        <p>\n        <img src=\"./images/skemio_01.png\"/>\n        \n\n        \n\n        The idea of ​​creating a platform for visual programming arose from a colleague for a long time. We discussed the prospects of such a project, how much they will be interesting to people. And after one of the discussions, we decided to try to create it!<br/><br/>\n\n\n        <iframe width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1CNeVVFcu4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><br/>\n\nThe idea and programming was on the side of my colleague, I was responsible for creating the visual part and UX. The aim of the project was to create a tool for advanced users with which they could make their program / website. The idea was that there are a lot of site designers at the moment, but most often they are imprisoned for a certain framework and technology. We wanted to give the user a maximum of possibilities, both over the visual part and over the data.\n\n\nInitially, we chose the graphic design approach. A successful concept has been made. In general, everything worked, it was cool. But at some point, we realized that you won’t go far on this. There were some restrictions on the code. It was decided to move in a different direction.\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_02.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_03.png\"/>\nAfter about a year, the concept was approved and I started sketching and choosing a style for the platform. In parallel, a website was created on which we collected e-mails of users who were interested in our product. I was also actively engaged in promotion in social networks. I tried on myself in the role of a specialist in marketing :).\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_04.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_05.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_06.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_08.png\"/>\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, due to some circumstances, my colleague and I decided to postpone the project until the best time. Participating in a startup gave me a lot of experience in managing time, it showed that sometimes it is necessary to fulfill different roles and be more flexible. It was a very valuable experience!\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_07.png\"/>\n        </p>\n        <div id=\"down_margin\"></div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default skemio;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n \nclass wispi extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n                <div id=\"up_margin\"></div>\n        <center><h1>Wispi</h1></center>\n        <p>\n        <center>\n        <div id=\"unselect\">\n\n        <video width=\"900\" height=\"506\" loop=\"loop\" controls=\"true\">\n            <source src=\"video/wispi_features.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n            <source src=\"video/wispi_features.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n        </video>            \n        </div>\n        </center>\n        I was invited to the project at the very beginning. The task was to completely redesign the existing messenger to modern app, as well as to work on creating new functionality as a UX/UI designer. And all this had to be done alone.\n        <img src=\"./images/wispi_01.png\"/>\nWhen I agreed to work on the project, I didn’t even fully understand how much work would fall on me for the next two and a half years! Not only did I need to redo\\create a design for iOS and Android, I needed to create prototypes and materials for social, do presentations, solve issues with development teams, find time for design review, help our BA on writing BDD and many otber unexpected things. This was a serious test for my time management skills.\n\nAs it turned out, there were no source files (surprise-surprise), so I had to start work literally from scratch. Additionally I did not have experience working in Sketch. So I had to iMac and rapidly study the Mac ecosystem and Sketch. It was a difficult time, much was not clear to me. Looking back, I see how much I did wrong \\ inefficient \\ overcomplicated.\n<img src=\"./images/wispi_02.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/wispi_05.png\"/>\n\nTo present existing or new functionality, I used Sketch (for creating screens) + Photoshop (for creating schemes). At first it was convenient, since I used the ability of Photoshop to link images. This simplified the work if you needed to make changes to the screens. I just re-saved the screens and updated the scheme in Photoshop.\n\nAfter some time, thanks to the Sketch plugin, I managed to completely get rid of the heavyweight Photoshop completely. I collected screens and schemes completely in a Sketch. At the end I had about 40 schemes.\n\n<img src=\"./images/wispi_04.png\"/>\n\nI quickly enough realized that for such number of screens and states (at the end I had about 2000 screens) it is simply vital to make a centralized system with components that would make my work more effective not only for me, but also for developers.\n\n<img src=\"./images/wispi_03.png\"/>\n\nIn the course of work, we decided to use native solutions. I had to carefully study the iOS/Android material design guidelines again.\n\nIn my free minutes I was able to work on the content for the application - to make small animations with the logo, which were then used in the application!\n\nFor a more effective work of the team, I prototyped the functionality of the application using Framer Studio. This application helped me to test hypotheses on my own in order to feel how convenient it is to use.\n<img src=\"./images/wispi_06.png\"/>\n<center>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/302696257\" width=\"640\" height=\"1115\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/302696257\">wispi_coding</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user4078803\">apegrave</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/302696330\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center><br/>\nIn addition, I was constantly in touch with the CEO, so I understood where to move, his advice and instructions helped me to stay on track. Together we searched for options how to improve the application, came up with new functionality. There were a lot of ideas, concepts, not everything was brought into the application. It was a very difficult and interesting time at the same time!\n\nWorking in a team of very cool professionals has given me a lot, both professionally and in personal growth.\n        </p>\n        <div id=\"down_margin\"></div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default wispi;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n \nclass gifts extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div id=\"up_margin\"></div>\n        <center><h1>Tango gifts</h1></center>\n        <p>\n        <center>\n        <div id=\"unselect\">\n\n            <video width=\"375\" height=\"415\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\">\n                <source src=\"video/amazing.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n                <source src=\"video/amazing.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n            </video>            \n            </div>\n            </center>\n        As a product designer, you often face non-trivial tasks. One of these tasks was to create animated gifts in the application. On the one hand, the task does not seem to be very difficult - just make a beautiful animation. Difficulties arise when you need to make an animation that meets the requirements of the platform, business objectives, and constraints.\n        <center>\n        <div id=\"unselect\">\n\n            <video width=\"380\" height=\"380\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\">\n                <source src=\"video/hearts-arrow.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n                <source src=\"video/hearts-arrow.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n            </video>            \n            <video width=\"380\" height=\"380\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\">\n                <source src=\"video/elf.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n                <source src=\"video/elf.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n            </video>\n            </div>\n            </center>\nI believe that the ability of a designer to work with different tools and be able to solve tasks is one of the most important skills of a product designer.\n\nAt the very beginning, we sat down with the developers and managers and thought about what gifts should be and what restrictions should be so that later there would be no problems.\n\nFor the presentation of the final picture and subsequent export, I used After Effects. Next, I exported all the data to json and compiled the final archive.<br/><br/>\n<img src=\"./images/tango_gifts_01.png\"/>\nAn important requirement for animated gifts was the size of the final archive. The most “lightweight” option was to create an animation with several pictures, and the animation itself should be implemented with 4 properties: position, rotation, transparency and scale. The most \"heavy\" option was to create frame-by-frame animation. Since in the requirements it was agreed to make an animation 30 frames per second, it is easy to calculate that if each frame of the animation weighs, for example, 50 kb, a 5 second clip will weigh approximately 7.3 megabytes. Keeping in mind that the animation of the gift is loaded by the client - these are very large numbers.\n<img src=\"./images/tango_gifts_02.png\"/>\n\nIn such a situation, it is necessary to maintain a balance and combine “lightweight” and “heavy” animation to achieve an acceptable result. For an important animated gift, we could afford to use \"heavy\" animation, and for less - \"lightweight\".<br/><br/>\n\nSometimes quite complex ideas (piercing, overflowing) can be achieved at a low price, if you look a little. Below is a 3D scan of how the animation of piercing the arrow of the cupid of hearts was made.\n<center>\n<div id=\"unselect\">\n\n<video width=\"375\" height=\"375\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\">\n    <source src=\"video/3d_gift.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n    <source src=\"video/3d_gift.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n</video>            \n</div>\n</center>\n\nSometimes I had to use 3D max to realize ideas, in this case I created a 3D model, rendered it, then exported everything to After Effects.\n<center>\n<div id=\"unselect\">\n            <video width=\"380\" height=\"380\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\">\n                <source src=\"video/bugatti.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n                <source src=\"video/bugatti.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n            </video>        \n            <video width=\"380\" height=\"380\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\">\n                <source src=\"video/diamond.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n                <source src=\"video/diamond.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n            </video>   \n            </div>\n            </center>\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default gifts;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport {\n  Route,\n  NavLink,\n  HashRouter\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Home from \"./Home\";\nimport about from \"./about\";\nimport nf from \"./nf\";\nimport spbtv from \"./spbtv\";\nimport amediateka from \"./amediateka\";\nimport skemio from \"./skemio\";\nimport wispi from \"./wispi\";\nimport gifts from \"./gifts\";\n\nclass Main extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <HashRouter>\n        \n        <div id=\"main\">\n            <div class=\"header\">\n                <a href=\"./\"><div class=\"logo\"><h2>Anatoly Sidorov</h2></div></a>\n                <div class=\"menu\">\n                    <NavLink exact to=\"/\">Works</NavLink>&emsp;\n                    <NavLink to=\"/about\">About</NavLink>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"content\">\n\n                <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home}/>\n                <Route path=\"/about\" component={about}/>\n                <Route path=\"/amediateka\" component={amediateka}/>\n                <Route path=\"/nf\" component={nf}/>\n                <Route path=\"/spbtv\" component={spbtv}/>\n                <Route path=\"/skemio\" component={skemio}/>\n                <Route path=\"/wispi\" component={wispi}/>\n                <Route path=\"/gifts\" component={gifts}/>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n      </HashRouter>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Main;","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport Main from \"./Main\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\n \nReactDOM.render(\n    \n  <Main/>, \n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);  "],"sourceRoot":""}
